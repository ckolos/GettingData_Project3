Data Dictionary - Getting and Cleaning Data, Week 3 Project

Subject
  Integer ranging from 1 to 30 representing each subject in the study

Activity
  A factor representing one of the following possible activities tested:

    ID      Action
     1       WALKING
     2       WALKING_UPSTAIRS
     3       WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
     4       SITTING
     5       STANDING
     6       LAYING

  Only the Action value is shown in the summary document.

Variables:
  66 variables were extracted from the parent data sets. These variables are the mean
  and standard deviation for the given measurement. Variable names beginning with 't'
  are time based, while those beginning with 'f' are the result of a Fast Fourier Transform
  done to the measurement. Measurements were recorded in each of the 3 principle dimensions,
  with X being lateral, Y being vertical, and Z being depth. Please note, variable names
  have not been altered from their original, fairly descriptive values.

Data users should be aware that the data represented has been summarized from a
much larger data source. The summary data is 180 rows by 68 columns.

Measurements contained in the summary file have been rounded to 4 digits.
